SatietyAndAgriculture
You need to take into account your satiety to clear the land, when the satiety is too low, there will be a attribute punishment, and when the satiety is high, there will be a attribute reward, by eating food to supplement the satiety.
Provides a variety of ways to obtain food, modified to add a variety of food formulations.
You can buy hoes and sickles from merchants to develop agriculture, crops need wet arable land to grow normally, some crops can be picked by right clicking after maturity, and the ripening speed of crops can be adjusted by itself.
The module is currently developing a variety of crops and animal husbandry, so look forward to it.
